non-integral cardinality

"Well, there is one set of cardinality 0; one set of cardinality one; one set of cardinality 2, but since its automorphism group has order 2, we only count it with multiplicity 1/2; there is one set of cardinality 3, counted with multiplicity 1/3!; ... So the number of sets is ..1+1/2!+1/3!...=e "
